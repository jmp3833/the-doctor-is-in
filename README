Some coworkers have a screen outside their office area which displays
which people are "in" or "out".  They have it plugged into a raspberry
pi with a bluetooth dongle which is paired to everyone's phones.

We are hoping to make a less "hacky" version of that code.  

Design goals:

Multiple screens in communication with each other.
	instead of "in" or "out" it can specify location too
		"Emilio is OUT and in Research Computing"
	fedmsg may be the backend for this

Ease method of pairing devices.  
	Perhaps even sniffing wireless and just looking for a mac address

Simple management interface
	Web pages are pretty.  Lets manage from that.  
	A single management interface for all screens perhaps?

Portability
	No Raspberry?  Who cares. "Linux" would be the main requirment

Headless capability
	A display isn't needed in the data center, but having a 
	checkpoint in there would be handy

Secure(ish)
	Make it hard to man-in-the-middle or inject messages.
	Make it easy to opt-out/in
